<h1>Deadeye</h1>
<p>Your favorite feature from the RDR game series ported over to GMOD!</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>Currently this mod is in the raw state. A lot of things can be done better and a lot of things should be done. At this point it's usable but expect lots of issues. The visuals and audio are mostly done (I might do the core visualization just like in the game) and the base functionality is practically done, admittedly buggy.<br>Along with this there's a pretty sneaky workaround that you must know about: sensitivity convar now acts as a mouse precision changer. Due to the aiming method used for deadeye, it's necessary to somehow increase mouse input precision so it's not jittery. To change the mouse input speed you have to change the cl_deadeye_mouse_sensitivity command instead.</p>

<h2>Before reporting a bug or a suggestion</h2>
<p>This mod is invasive as hell. It'll destroy everything in its path in order to achieve the needed effect. Therefore there can be a lot of conflicts and overlaps. You can report them and I'll look into them but I don't guarantee them getting fixed because sometimes it's outright impossible.</p>
