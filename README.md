<h1>Deadeye</h1>
<p>Your favorite feature from the RDR game series ported over to GMOD!</p>

<h2>General Information</h2>
<p>There's a pretty sneaky workaround that you must know about: sensitivity convar now acts as a mouse precision changer. Due to the aiming method used for deadeye, it's necessary to somehow increase mouse input precision so it's not jittery. To change the mouse input speed you have to change the cl_deadeye_mouse_sensitivity command instead.<br>Also yeah this goes without saying but this mod WONT WORK ON MULTIPLAYER AND NEVER WILL. DONT EVEN ASK ME</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>cl_deadeye_mark - create an aim point<br>
cl_deadeye_clear - clear points (broken)<br>
cl_deadeye_toggle - toggle deadeye<br>
cl_deadeye_timer (number) - change the deadeye timer<br>
cl_deadeye_bar (0/1) - disable/enable the charge bar<br>
cl_deadeye_bar_mode (0-2) - several text modes for the charge bar (details can be seen in-game)<br>
cl_deadeye_bar_offset_x - self-explanatory<br>
cl_deadeye_bar_offset_y - self-explanatory<br>
cl_deadeye_mouse_sensitivity - replacement for the sensitivity convar<br>
cl_deadeye_accurate (0/1) - Instead of aiming at the [hitbox position + offset], aim just at the hitbox position<br>
cl_deadeye_infinite (0/1) - make the thang infinite

<h2>Before reporting a bug or a suggestion</h2>
<p>This mod is invasive as hell. It'll destroy everything in its path in order to achieve the needed effect. Therefore there can be a lot of conflicts and overlaps. You can report them and I'll look into them but I don't guarantee them getting fixed because sometimes it's outright impossible.</p>
